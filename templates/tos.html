                <li>Influencers that fail to upload screenshots (or provide a link) for stopped orders, may have their withdrawal not processed until proof is provided and verified by Shoutcart team member.</li>
                <li>Permanent shoutouts are required to stay on your social media account for the lifetime of your account. If permanent shoutouts are removed from your social media account, you will be subject to removal from Shoutcart and fees for all your shoutouts reversed from your balance.</li>
